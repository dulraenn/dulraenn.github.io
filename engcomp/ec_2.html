        <h2>Simple, Every-day Things You Can Do</h2><hr>
            <h3>Eat less beef & lamb</h3>
            <p>I'm not saying to go vegan overnight– just reduce. Cows and sheep produce a <it>lot</it> of methane. Swapping out red meat once or twice a week helps much more than you'd think.</p>
            <h3>Turn down your water heater by a few degrees</h3>
            <p>For example, turning your water heater from 140°F to 120°F. Doing this will save you energy <it>every day</it>, automatically, and you'll hardly realize.</p>
            <h3>Unplug unused electronics</h3>
            <p>Things like toasters, game consoles, monitors, chargers, etc. draw power even when they're "off." You can unplug them or, for a simpler solution, plug them all into a power strip and then just flip the switch off before you go to bed. You'll be saving both energy and a bit of money.</p>
            <h3>Go paperless for mail, bills, receipts</h3>
            <p>There's no reason to be receiving a tree's worth of paper every week– most banks, stores, and other companies will let you opt out. It only takes a couple minutes and saves a lot of waste in the long term.</p>
            <h3>Support local climate policy</h3>
            <p>Even just voting or emailing a representative when big bills are being voted on can make a difference. Systemic change beats 10,000 reuseable straws.</p>
            <h3>Walk or bike short distances</h3>
            <p>Even if it's just on occasion. Not only are car trips under 3 miles terrible for efficiency, the simple fact of there being less emissions is a plus.</p>
