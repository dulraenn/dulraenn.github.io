    <h1>About this Website–</h1>
    <p>This is a website I created for my Computer Coding class. I based it around the game League of Legends, listing a few champions that I find interesting. The list is mainly demigods or just characters whose backgrounds/concepts intrigue me.</p>

    <h1>About me–</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kadyn, a Junior at Augusta High School. I learned how to make websites a couple years ago in my freshman year, if I'm remembering correctly. Me and one of my friends decided to learn how to make them and then we'd compare our websites and give updates on what we made. My first website wasn't (and still isn't) very impressive. You can find it at <a class="hyperlink" href="https://vxperr.github.io">vxperr.github.io</a>. If you look at it, I think it becomes pretty obvious that I just followed tutorials I found on W3Schools. The second website I made was <a href="https://ichijuuyon.github.io" class="hyperlink">ichijuuyon.github.io</a>. I made this one a while later</p>
