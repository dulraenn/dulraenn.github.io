    <h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>
    <p>League of Legends is a popular MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game where players control unique
    characters called champions, battling in teams to destroy the enemy base while defending their own.
    It's all about strategy, teamwork, and piloting your champion as skillfully as you can.</p>
